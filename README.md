📌 Healthcare - Patient Readmission Analysis

This project analyzes a healthcare dataset of diabetic patient admissions to identify factors affecting patient readmission within 30 days.
Currently, this project includes the initial data loading and basic structure for further EDA and ML modeling.

🔍 Objective

To explore hospital readmission patterns and understand:

Which patients are more likely to be readmitted?

Which factors (age, time in hospital, number of medications, etc.) influence readmission?

How hospitals can improve patient care using data insights.
